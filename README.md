# Angular GitHub Search App
This project is the result of my code-along to the Angular GitHub app, [Angular 2 GitHub Application (RC6 Update)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL_2FnIBVgI) by *Brad Traversy*.  There have been minor updates to the original code, but the app is for the most part, the same.  This project was originally developed in Angular 2 RC6 and has been updated to **Angular 5** and styled using the [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io).
